**# Bike-Rental-Forecasting**

We will be using multiple linear regression model to forecast bike rental for Mr. John Hughes using the bike rental dataset.
Multiple linear regression is used to model and quantify the relationship between two or more independent variables and a dependent variable. 

The independent variables in the dataset are; Temperature, Humidity, Wind, Visibility, Dew Point, Rainfall, Snowfall, & Season, while the dependent variable is Rental Count.
Multiple linear regression is a parametric approach characterized by specific assumptions about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables in the model. 
These assumptions include.
Linearity: Multiple regression assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear
Independence of observations: Multiple regression assumes that there is no relationship between the various observations. 
Normality of Residuals: Multiple regression typically assumes that the errors are normally distributed.
No or little Multicollinearity: This implies that the explanatory variables are not strongly correlated.


**OUR OBJECTIVES**

We will be using a multiple linear regression model to forecast bike rental for Mr. John Hughes using the bike rental dataset. Multiple linear regression is used to model and quantify the relationship between two or more independent variables and a dependent variable. 
We will be creating a multivariate model and developing a regression model to explain the magnitude and direction(inverse or direct) of each independent variable on the dependent variable.
We present the regression output and use the performance metrics to evaluate the model
We will give two recommendations to our client on how to improve the model.
